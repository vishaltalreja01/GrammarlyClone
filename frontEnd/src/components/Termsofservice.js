                <p>
                    Note: If your organization has signed up for Writeophonic Business or Writeophonic for Education, our online (available here) or offline Writeophonic Customer Business Agreement will govern your use of your Writeophonic team account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to Writeophonic! These terms of service govern your use of our products. References to our products in this terms of service refer to all of our products and services, including our apps, websites, and software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to these terms, we publish a Privacy Policy that describes how we process, collect, use, and protect your information.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Mission and Business Model</h3>
                <p>Our mission is to improve lives by improving communication.</p>
                <p>We offer free and paid products and hope you’ll purchase one of our paid products. We don’t sell your data.</p>
                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>Writeophonic products are provided by Writeophonic, Inc., a Delaware corporation. For more information about Writeophonic, please visit <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/about">https://www.Writeophonic.com/about</a>.</p>
                <h3>Paid Accounts</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Billing:</strong> You can upgrade your account to access paid features, which would turn your account into a paid account. When you do that, we’ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a paid account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. You are responsible for all applicable taxes, and we’ll charge tax when required. Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn’t override these laws.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Refunds:</strong> You may cancel your Writeophonic paid account at any time (instructions on how to do that are <a href="https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000090991-How-to-Cancel-a-Paid-Subscription">here</a>). Refunds are issued if they are required by law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Downgrades:</strong> Your paid account will remain in effect until it’s canceled or terminated under these terms. If you don’t pay for your paid account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your access to the free version of our products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Free trials:</strong> Writeophonic may offer a free trial membership. If you are using a free trial membership and cancel it before the end of the trial period, all your rights to any remaining free trial period will end (unless you started your trial via our iOS app, in which case your trial will continue until the end of the trial period). Typically, we will only offer one free trial per user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Changes:</strong> We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice before those changes take effect. Any change in prices will apply to your next billing cycle.
                </p>


                <h2>Your Ownership of Your Data and the Limited Permissions You Give Us</h2>
                <p>User Content refers to the text and documents you enter, upload, and transmit when you use our products.</p>
                <p>You own your User Content; Writeophonic doesn’t own it. To provide our products to you, we need your permission (in legal language, a license) to use your User Content.</p>
                <p>You grant us a license to your User Content for the limited purposes of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating, providing, improving, troubleshooting, and debugging our products (for example, your acceptance or rejection of suggestions may help train our suggestion engine);</li>
                    <li>Protecting our products (for example, to analyze patterns in usage to prevent abuse);</li>
                    <li>Customizing our products (for example, to create personalized suggestions for you);</li>
                    <li>Developing new products or features (for example, creating our tone detector); and</li>
                    <li>Using information you upload or provide to us (such as your name) to encourage other people in your organization to join your Writeophonic Business or Writeophonic for Education team account.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The license you give us is only for the above purposes. That means we will not, for example, sell or license your User Content to third-party data brokers.</p>
                <p>The license you grant us is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worldwide (so you can access your User Content from anywhere in the world);</li>
                    <li>Non-exclusive (meaning you own your User Content and can also license it to other people or companies);</li>
                    <li>Royalty-free (meaning we don’t pay you for it); and</li>
                    <li>For as long as intellectual property laws protect your User Content.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The license you give us allows us to—solely for the purposes outlined above—store, reproduce, use, publish, and publicly display (to show your User Content to you), modify, and create derivative works of (such as providing writing suggestions and autocorrecting words) your User Content. The license you give us also permits our service providers to assist us in doing this.</p>
                <p>Writeophonic does not own, control, verify, or endorse User Content. You are responsible for all of your User Content. That means you should back up all your User Content and not do anything illegal or harmful with it (including violate any intellectual property or trade secret laws).</p>


                <h2>Our Intellectual Property Rights and License to You</h2>
                <p>Some of our products allow you to download client software. So long as you comply with these terms, we give you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use our client software solely to access the products.</p>
                <p>Our products are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. Except for this limited license, we reserve all right, title, and interest in our products, trademarks, logos, and other brand features. We welcome feedback, but you agree that we can use that feedback without restriction or any obligation to you.</p>

                <h2>Your Use of WriteophonicGO</h2>
                <p>Additional terms apply when you use WriteophonicGO. WriteophonicGO refers to our generative AI services and features.</p>
                <p>Generated Content. You may use WriteophonicGO to submit inputs and receive generated outputs. When you use WriteophonicGO, the inputs and outputs are your User Data. You are responsible for your User Data and will not use WriteophonicGO in a way that infringes, violates, or misappropriates any of our rights or the rights of any third party. You acknowledge that due to the nature of machine learning and the technology powering WriteophonicGO, outputs may not be unique and Writeophonic may generate the same or similar output for third parties.</p>
                <p>Usage Limits. Depending on your subscription plan, you may have a limit on your use of WriteophonicGO. You acknowledge and agree that if you exceed the usage limit allotted by your subscription plan: (i) you may be required to purchase additional usage to continue accessing and using WriteophonicGO and (ii) Writeophonic may suspend or degrade performance of the WriteophonicGO features. You acknowledge that any purchased usage for WriteophonicGO is tied to your Writeophonic subscription plan, and account termination will invalidate any remaining purchased usage.</p>
                <p>Usage Restrictions. You may not use WriteophonicGO:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To develop foundation or large language models that compete with Writeophonic or WriteophonicGO;</li>
                    <li>To mislead any third party that any output from WriteophonicGO was solely human generated;</li>
                    <li>In a manner that violates these terms, Writeophonic documentation, usage guidelines, or our Acceptable Use Policy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Writeophonic Business and Writeophonic for Education Users</h2>
                <p>Business terms. When you sign up for Writeophonic Business or Writeophonic for Education, your organization’s terms will govern your use of your Writeophonic team account.</p>
                <p>Using Writeophonic Business or Writeophonic for Education. If you join a Writeophonic Business or Writeophonic for Education team account, you must use the products in compliance with your organization’s terms and policies. Please note that Writeophonic team accounts are subject to your organization’s control. Your administrators can downgrade, restrict, or terminate your access to a Writeophonic team account and view information about it. Also, if you are a Writeophonic for Education team member, your parents and school administrator may have the legal right to access your account or delete it.</p>


                <h2>Limitations on Use and Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>Acceptable Use Policy. You must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy when you use our products.</p>
                <p>Keeping your account information up to date and safe. You are responsible for safeguarding your password to our products. Don’t share your account credentials or give others access to your account. We will use your account email address to contact you about our products, so you must ensure that your account information stays current.</p>
                <p>Minimum age requirements. To use our products, you must be at least 13 if you reside in the United States and 16 if you reside anywhere else. If the law where you reside requires that you are older for us to lawfully provide our products to you without parental consent (including using your information), you must be that age. You may not use our products if you don’t meet these age requirements. However, if your parents or guardians have allowed you to join a Writeophonic for Education team, you may still use our products.</p>
                <h2>Termination</h2>
                <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our products with notice to you if:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You have breached these terms or our Acceptable Use Policy,</li>
                    <li>You use the products in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to other Writeophonic users or us, or</li>
                    <li>You don’t have a paid account and haven’t accessed our products for 12 consecutive months.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Before suspending or terminating your account, we’ll (1) provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account so you can try to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and (2) allow you to export your documents from our products. If you fail to take the steps we ask of you after such notice, we’ll terminate or suspend your access to our products.</p>
                <p>We won’t provide notice before termination where we believe that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You’re in material breach of these terms or our Acceptable Use Policy,</li>
                    <li>Doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide our products to our other users, or</li>
                    <li>The law prohibits us from providing notice.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When this agreement terminates for any reason, all the sections one would expect to survive will survive, including, but not limited to, “Warranty Disclaimers,” “Limitation of Liability,” “Resolving Disputes,” “Miscellaneous Legal Terms,” “Our Intellectual Property Rights and License,” and “Paid Accounts.” The termination of this agreement doesn’t affect any amounts owed before that termination.</p>
                <h2>Discontinuation and Modification of Products</h2>
                <p>We are continually changing and improving our products, and we may add or remove features or functionality. If we discontinue a product, where reasonably possible we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to download your stored User Content.</p>
                <h2>Open Source Software, Reverse Engineering, and Automatic Updates</h2>
                <p>To the extent any component of our Software may be offered under open-source license terms that we make available to you, see here for a list of the open-source software that we use. The provisions of open-source licenses may expressly override some of these terms.</p>
                <p>Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile our products, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so. Our products may update themselves automatically to ensure you’re using the latest version.</p>
                <h2>Third-Party Websites</h2>
                <p>Any links to third-party websites or apps are provided for your convenience only and are subject to the third party’s terms. Writeophonic isn’t responsible or liable for those websites, products, or services.</p>
                <h2>Beta Products</h2>
                <p>We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. We will mark these products with the words “beta,” “preview,” “early access,” or “evaluation” (or with words or phrases with similar meanings). If you decide to use them, please remember that they may not be as reliable or as thoroughly tested as our other products. To improve and evaluate these products, we will log and analyze information about how you use and interact with them.</p>





                <h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>
                <p>Let’s try to sort things out first. Before filing a claim against Writeophonic, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting support@Writeophonic.com. We’ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If you and we cannot resolve the dispute informally, then a party seeking to bring a formal proceeding must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Writeophonic should be sent to 548 Market Street, #35410, San Francisco, CA 94104, Attn: Legal Department. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Writeophonic and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after receiving the Notice, you or Writeophonic may commence a formal proceeding.</p>
                <p>Judicial forum for disputes. You and Writeophonic agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these terms or our products will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Writeophonic consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts (for example, European Union member states), this paragraph doesn’t affect those requirements.</p>
                <p>IF YOU’RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</p>
                <p>We both agree to arbitrate. You and Writeophonic agree to resolve any claims relating to these terms or our products through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under “Exceptions to agreement to arbitrate” below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>
                <p>Opt-out of agreement to arbitrate. You have the right to opt out of these arbitration provisions (and any future changes to arbitration provisions) by emailing arbitration-opt-out@Writeophonic.com within 30 days of agreeing to a version of these terms containing arbitration terms (however, if you agreed to a previous version of these terms of service that contain an arbitration provision, you are still bound by those arbitration provisions).</p>
                <p>Arbitration procedures. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in San Francisco County, California, or any other location we agree to. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Writeophonic or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Writeophonic is entitled.</p>
                <p>Arbitration fees and incentives. The AAA rules will govern the payment of all arbitration fees. Writeophonic will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for non-frivolous claims less than $75,000. Writeophonic will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
                <p>Exceptions to agreement to arbitrate. Either you or Writeophonic may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California, or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the products or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California, to resolve your claim.</p>
                <p>NO CLASS ACTIONS. You may only resolve disputes with us individually. That is, you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren’t allowed.</p>
                <p>Severability. If the “NO CLASS ACTIONS” paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section will be deemed void. If you are found to have a non-waivable right to bring a specific claim or request a specific form of relief that an arbitrator lacks the authority to redress or award under this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including public injunctive relief, then only that particular claim or request may be brought in court, and you and we agree that litigation of this claim or request will be stayed pending the resolution of any other claims or requests for relief in arbitration.</p>
                <h2>Controlling Law</h2>
                <p>California law will govern these terms except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer’s country. This paragraph doesn’t override those laws.</p>




                <h2>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h2>
                <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
                <p>These terms make up the entire agreement between you and Writeophonic, Inc., regarding your use of our products. They supersede any prior agreements.</p>
                <h3>Waiver, Severability, and Assignment</h3>
                <p>Writeophonic’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision (other than the “NO CLASS ACTIONS” paragraph) is unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full effect, and an enforceable term will be substituted with the goal of reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these terms, and any such attempt will be void. Writeophonic may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries or any successor in interest of any business associated with the products.</p>
                <h3>Modifications to These Terms</h3>
                <p>From time to time, we may revise these terms to, for example, reflect changes to the law, new regulations, and changes to our products.</p>
                <p>If an update significantly negatively affects your use of our products or your legal rights as a user of our products, we’ll notify you before the update’s effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. We will give you at least 30 days after that notice before the update takes effect.</p>
                <p>We may also update these terms in ways that won’t significantly negatively affect your rights. For example, we may change the feature or product names or change the email address you can use to contact us. In those cases, we will post the change to our website and link to the previous version.</p>
                <p>If you don’t agree to the updates we make, you must cancel your account before they become effective. Where required, we’ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for our products and your account cancellation date. By using or accessing the products after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
